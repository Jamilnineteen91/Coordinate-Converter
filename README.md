# Coordinate-Converter
These functions convert DMS (degree, minutes, seconds) coordinates to DD (decimal degrees) and vice versa.

## Built with
-[re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) Regular expression operations library

## Status
Incomplete

## Bugs
- [ ] Fix decimals in dd_to_dms function.
- [ ] Condense DMS parse.

## What I learned

- How to parse with the re. library
- How to condense code by means of function comprehension
- The value of data structures in algorithms
